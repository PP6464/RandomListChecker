# Random Number Checker
This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network to check if a list of integers (length 1-100, each element is an integer from 1-100), is a human-generated random list of integers or a computer-generated random list of integers.

There are 1000 computer-generated random numbers and 1000 human-generated random numbers.
